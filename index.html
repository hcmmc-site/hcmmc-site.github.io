                        Attempting to solve 12 problems in only an hour is crazy, but it's also really fun because there's no pressure and the problems are hilarious.

                        All divisions have at least three really hard problems, so students will learn to budget their time according to what they can reasonably finish in 60 minutes. If they make it through the first nine problems, the last three will offer a substantial challenge!

                        Mr. G. and the executive team organize the event and write most of the problems. The City of Cupertino provides the space, the Math Olympiads TAs proctor the contest and grade them, and Mr. G. and the Chen family provide snacks and awards. Harrison would have liked it this way, so that's the way we've always done it.
