                        Hi, I'm Mr. G.  I've been teaching Math Olympiads in the Cupertino area for two decades, and HCMMC is the highlight of the year for our students.  We write the problems with intentionally silly but fun stories so that everyone can enjoy taking the contest.  When I'm not doing math, I enjoy board games, cooking, baking, hiking, tennis, playing piano, and generally being creative.  I look forward to seeing you at HCMMC!

                        Hi! I am Dylan, one of the problem writers for HCMMC.  I am a senior in high school, Teaching Assistant for Math Olympiads, and I also teach Advanced Topics in Mathematics 3. My HCMMC achievements include winning the Genius Division twice and writing many creative problems for HCMMC, including Square Disease and the Mr. Monta Vista series. My favorite aspect of HCMMC is how it involves categories of problems seen nowhere else: one example is MGCNGQ's (Mr. G Crazy Name Games Questions).

                    <p>
                        Besides math and HCMMC, I love board games, hiking, and cycling.

                    <p>
                        Hi there, my name is Ved! I'm an undergraduate student at UCSB majoring in computer science, and I serve as a point person and the website administrator for HCMMC. I was a TA for Math Olympiads from 2019 to 2023, and I've been crafting HCMMC problems since 2020. My favorite aspect of the HCMMC experience is reading the crazy, wacky stories that each problem is set in; it's such a fun, enjoyable way to celebrate our mutual love of math!
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        A fun fact about me is that I was an international level athlete in Taekwon-Do and represented Team USA at the 2023 World Championships.
